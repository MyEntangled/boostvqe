# Boost VQEs with DBI

Boosting variational eigenstate preparation algorithms limited by training and not device coherence by diagonalization double-bracket iteration.

#### basically, do VQE, VQA and DBI together and seach for improvements

#### Marek goal

This should be viewed as the faster paced project where we just search for advantages and showcase ideas.

Here we are preparing the more detailed analysis
