Main branch

https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/tree/master/examples/dbi

New cost functions from Andrew

https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/tree/dbi_cost_functions/examples/dbi

https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/tree/dbi_scheduling_SA

BHMM DBI by Sam (good for simple checks because you only take 1 D operator for all steps)

https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/tree/dbi_BHMM

Might be obsolete but runs the basic scheduling strategies

https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/tree/dbi_scheduling/examples/dbi

When you want a simple DBI take D(B) = \sum_i B_i Z_i

Marekâ€™s developing branch for transpiling DBI into Hamiltonian simulation (and then to primitive gates) has the evolution oracle examples in the models/dbi folder https://github.com/qiboteam/qibo/tree/DBI_transpiling_code_structure_waiting_merge/src/qibo/models/dbi

Boosting VQE (access via DBI team) has the basic running setup in the README
